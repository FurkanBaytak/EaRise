EaRise
======

EaRise is a cross-platform application developed using Flutter and Dart, structured as a modular and scalable mobile software project. Rather than focusing on a single feature, the repository serves as a foundation for clean architecture, maintainable UI composition, and platform-independent development practices.

The project emphasizes:
- Separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data layers
- Reusable widget-based interface design
- Cross-platform deployment for Android and iOS from a single codebase
- Readable, extensible project structure suitable for team development

EaRise functions as a technical portfolio piece that highlights proficiency in modern mobile development workflows, reactive UI design, and software architecture principles. It demonstrates the ability to design systems that are not only functional but also maintainable and scalable over time, which is a key requirement in professional product development environments.
